# COVID-19 Fake News Classification: Machine Learning and Deep Learning Solution

This project provides a robust tool for classifying fake news related to COVID-19. It employs both machine learning and deep learning models to identify and categorize misinformation, contributing to combating the spread of fake news during the pandemic.

## Features
- **Multi-Model Support**: Includes several pre-trained models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Naive Bayes
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting
  - LSTM and Bi-LSTM (Deep Learning)
  - GRU (Deep Learning)
- **Text Preprocessing Pipeline**: Cleans and processes text data for accurate classification.
- **Streamlit Web Application**: Offers an interactive interface for real-time fake news detection.
- **Ready for Deployment**: Configured for deployment on platforms like Heroku.
