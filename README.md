## Dataset

The project uses publicly available datasets of COVID-19-related news articles. Hereâ€™s an overview:

### Dataset Format:
- **Text**: The news headline or article content.
- **Label**: The classification label:
  - **Fake**: Denotes misinformation.
  - **Real**: Denotes legitimate news.

#### Example:
- **Text**: "COVID-19 vaccines cause infertility in women." Label: Fake
- **Text**: "WHO approves the Pfizer vaccine for emergency use." Label: Real

### Fields:
- **ID**: Unique identifier for each news entry.
- **Content**: Text of the news article or headline.
- **Target**: Binary label indicating whether the news is real or fake.
